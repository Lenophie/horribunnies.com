	<description>	
		Quasiphies is a French video-game studio/artistic collective (which has yet to be founded!).
		It is shaped around Lenophie's games and ideas, it gathers young talents from engineering and videogame/interactive media schools.
		They seek to make games that tell stories through game mechanics, games that make the players question their well-informed actions and beliefs.
		Quasiphies preaches love, inclusivity and tolerance. As such, many of its creations are designed to be cute yet weird.

			<header>Horribunnies !</header>
			<text>Lenophie participated in a game-jam organized by Abiding Bridge mid-2019. There, they met Pakrett, a graphic designer, the kind of talent Lenophie had been looking for to bring their vision to life ! Bunny enthusiasts as they are, they both settled for developing a bunny-related game in a minimal amount of time, so they could tell if they liked working together. The scope of the game grew and... voilà, the team was expanded with the arrival of a musician, a narrative designer and another graphic designer !</text>

			<header>Road to Quasiphies</header>
			<text>It is currently (Dec 2019) planned that Horribunnies will be released through Abiding Bridge, a publisher which doesn't require us to found a studio in order to work with us. Quasiphies remains, for now, a rallying word for the current team, a rallying word that may or may not grow into a fully-fledged artistic collective or games studio.</text>
