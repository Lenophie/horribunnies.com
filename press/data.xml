			<header>A bunch of buns</header>
			<text>While Lenophie and Herbie had entertained the idea of making games together for years, that wish took form during a game-jam in 2019 where Lenophie met Pakrett! We stacked together during various subsequent gamejams and started working on both Horribunnies and Pâquerette Down the Bunburrows.</text>

			<title>Pâquerette Down the Bunburrows</title>
			<description>Pâquerette Down the Bunburrows is a puzzle game where you get outsmarted by bunnies! It started as our entry to Ludum Dare 48 and grew a life of its own beyond the jam!</description>
